                    Free Code Camp makes it easier for aspiring web developers or beginners 
                to get started learning stuff without having to experience information overload. 
                <br/><br/>
                The topics or subjects in each tutorial are well structured. It also offers interactive learning which
                makes it easier and more fun to learn coding.
                <br/><br/>
                Even though I don't consider myself as a beginner since I already have a year of experience in web development,
                I still find this site very useful in reviewing the fundamentals of web development, which even the most
                experienced developer have missed to practice, since a vast of frameworks out there pop up to make 
                web development easier. Even if that's the case, it's still better to master the basics before moving forward to
                the more advance one. Without solid understanding to the basics it's almost impossible to understand advance topic.
                <br/><br/>
